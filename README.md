# GrampsView
Learning to program in C# by creating a Gramps genealogy viewer in Xamarin forms for Android, iOS and UWP.

---

Mainly for my benefit but may be of use to others. 


Based on some old WPF code that morphed into UWP that morphed into Xamarin that morphed into Maui.  Displaying the Gramps database is sufficiently complex to be useful while scratching the itch to have the Gramps data available when doing family history.

This was written for me and if you find it useful then great.  If it all ends badly or bursts into flames then that is a bad thing but you need to decide if this app is for you before you use it.  I do not guarentee it in any way what so ever.
