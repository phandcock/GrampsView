# GrampsView
Learning to program in C# by creating a Gramps genealogy viewer in Xamarin forms for Android, iOS and UWP.

---

Mainly for my benefit but may be of use to others. 


Based on some old WPF code that morphed into UWP that morphed into Xamarin.  Displaying the Gramps database is sufficiently complex to be useful while scratching the itch to have the Gramps data available when doing family history.
