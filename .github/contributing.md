As this is a project for my own benefit, I am not looking for contributions which is lucky as I doubt anybody else is interested :-).

I know the code is not great (that’s the whole learning c# bit).

If someone has a burning issue, then they can propose a change and I will probably include it but only if I can learn something from it.

Issues must be supplied with enough detail so I can work out what is going.  Vague questions about "why does not work" make me do extra work which I, honestly, would rather spend on my own coding issues.
