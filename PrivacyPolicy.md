# Collection of Routine Information
This app is in Beta mode and tracks basic information about users so I can hunt down bugs. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, app details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information is meant to personally identify specific users to this app.

# Settings
This stores some configuration information in the applications system settings about a users preferences and history in save time and effort when you run the program.

# Links to Third Party Websites
If the GPKG file contains links to websites then we are not responsible for their content.

# Security
The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee its absolute security.

This is an app I am learning to program with and because I need the family history data for research etc.  I do what I can but it's not a commercial app nor do I pretend that I am a great programmer.

Family history records can have all sorts of personal information in them.  We need to store this in a cache area on the system so we can display it.  Other than that we do not touch it (except as noted above).

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2020 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our app.
